- Prioritize ideas challenging conventional wisdom in specified focus areas  
- Include speaker's original frameworks/theories  

### INSIGHTS (10-20 items)  
- 16-word syntheses connecting multiple ideas into higher-order principles  
- Reveal hidden patterns between technology, culture, and cognition  
- Abstract concrete examples into universal human experiences  

### QUOTES (15-30 items)  
- Verbatim impactful statements demonstrating speaker's rhetorical style  
- Select claims with high predictive/ explanatory density

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS  
1. Decouple speaker's conjectures from evidence-backed claims using [Cochrane criteria]  
2. Contextualize insights within [Hilbert's 23 problems] equivalent for 21st-century challenges  
3. Apply [Graham's hierarchy of disagreement] to strengthen argument mapping  
4. Benchmark novel concepts against [Cynefin framework] complexity classes  

## OUTPUT STANDARDS  
- Hospital-grade concision: Maximum signal/noise ratio per lexical unit  
- Anti-redundancy protocols: Concept deduplication across sections  
- Semantic compression: 15% density increase over source material  
- Professional register: Maintain analytical neutrality with controlled urgency
